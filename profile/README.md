## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[typed.md](https://typed.md) is a WYSIWYG markdown editor inspired by Obsidian and Notion, aiming to combine the best features of these two editors into a single webapp.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Better note/folder renaming UI.

## Known bugs

- [ ] Drag handle doesn't work on first element.
